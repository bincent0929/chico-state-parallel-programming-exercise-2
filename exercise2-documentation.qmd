### a

In running my `edited-pthread.c` program, the only difference between runs is which thread presents its sum first.

For one run it may be:
```bash
Thread idx=0, sum[0...0]=5050
Thread idx=2, sum[0...2]=45150
Thread idx=3, sum[0...3]=80200
Thread idx=4, sum[0...4]=125250
Thread idx=1, sum[0...1]=20100
Thread idx=5, sum[0...5]=180300
Thread idx=6, sum[0...6]=245350
Thread idx=7, sum[0...7]=320400
TEST COMPLETE
```

But for another it could be:
```bash
Thread idx=0, sum[0...0]=5050
Thread idx=3, sum[0...3]=80200
Thread idx=2, sum[0...2]=45150
Thread idx=1, sum[0...1]=20100
Thread idx=4, sum[0...4]=125250
Thread idx=7, sum[0...7]=320400
Thread idx=5, sum[0...5]=180300
Thread idx=6, sum[0...6]=245350
```

Otherwise the values are the same.

There's A LOT of output that comes from the 1...1*10^6 program. So I can't really see the order exactly, but it does appear that the thread at index 4 finished last. Which makes it clear that the threads don't operate in sequential, numbered order.

Based on the output from `edit-sumnums.c`:
```bash
TEST COMPLETE: gsum[0]=4999950000, gsum[1]=14999950000, gsum[2]=24999950000, gsum[3]=34999950000, gsum[4]=44999950000, gsum[5]=54999950000, gsum[6]=64999950000, gsum[7]=74999950000, gsum[8]=84999950000, gsum[9]=94999950000, gsumall=500000500000
TEST COMPLETE: gsumall=500000500000, [n[n+1]]/2=500000500000
```

From the output, the outcome of each thread completing their job possibly out of numerical sequence does not have an impact on the final sum.
