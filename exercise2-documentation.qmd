### a

In running my `edited-pthread.c` program, the only difference between runs is which thread presents its sum first.

For one run it may be:
```bash
Thread idx=0, sum[0...0]=5050
Thread idx=2, sum[0...2]=45150
Thread idx=3, sum[0...3]=80200
Thread idx=4, sum[0...4]=125250
Thread idx=1, sum[0...1]=20100
Thread idx=5, sum[0...5]=180300
Thread idx=6, sum[0...6]=245350
Thread idx=7, sum[0...7]=320400
TEST COMPLETE
```

But for another it could be:
```bash
Thread idx=0, sum[0...0]=5050
Thread idx=3, sum[0...3]=80200
Thread idx=2, sum[0...2]=45150
Thread idx=1, sum[0...1]=20100
Thread idx=4, sum[0...4]=125250
Thread idx=7, sum[0...7]=320400
Thread idx=5, sum[0...5]=180300
Thread idx=6, sum[0...6]=245350
```

Otherwise the values are the same.
